Check the 'Save password' if you want the app remembering your login credentials.

Select the needed language of the application interface in the drop-down list \(the list allows selecting the application interface language independently of the device system language\).

Tap the button 'Log in'.

Note: to recover the application password, tap ‘Forgot’ option in the ‘Password’ field.
